# dotfiles

My dotfiles for bash, vim, etc.

[`.bash_profile`](macosx/.bash_profile) has some cool aliases:

- `f` performs a case-insensitive search of files via `find`
- `s` acts as a basic timer (sleeps for N seconds, then beeps)
- `t` displays a colorized [directory tree](http://mama.indstate.edu/users/ice/tree)
- `yt` and `yta` are wrappers for [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl)
